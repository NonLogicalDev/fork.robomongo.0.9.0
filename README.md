**Supported MongoDB Version:** 2.4

This is a binary only fork of Robomongo release 0.9. The last one before Robomongo switched to MongoDB v3.+.

The reason this outdated version is still relevant for me is UniFi Network management software is still stuck on MongoDB Version 2.4, and very occasionally I have to go into the weeds and tweak some data by hand to get UniFi to rename port profiles.

I have only compiled this version for MacOS, it was quite painful as it is and I did not have the heart to go compile it for Windows and linux.
I however documented my findings on a Wiki if someone is still in need of instructions on how to compile this very old version.
